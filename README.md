# EIP-4

Convolution:
A mathematical operation used to deduce feature from the image layer

Filters/Kernels:
Used to perform covolutions over image layers for feature extraction

Epochs:
Number of times the entire dataset is being iterated over

1x1 Convolution:
Aggreagates or summarizes features of all channels.Used to increase or decrease the number of channels

3x3 Convolution:
aggregating the feature information using a 3x3 kernel

Feature Maps:
feature maps are channels containing feature information after applying filters/kernels over image 

Activation Function:
It Used to bring non linearity in the data

Receptive Field:
receptive field of a pixel is the number of pixels information each pixel is able to capture
